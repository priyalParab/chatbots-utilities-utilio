# chatbots-utilities-utilio
Utilio is a digital assistant built on the RASA stack that enhances customer engagement. This project plans on exploiting various popular customer support codes and features across platforms to build a strong text and voice controlled, AI powered, multi-lingual, analytical assistant. The current version works by integrating Utilio with Oracle Utilities Application Framework (CC&B, C2M, MDM) via real-time web service calls for the utilities sector. The future versions can be extended to integrate with ORMB to enable Utilio to engage with traffic in the Banking sector.
The goal is to make the Utilio insightful, omni-channel compatible and supportive to purposeful automation.
Training this bot requires a colloquial feed of user-CSR conversations to match the local lingo that personifies the chat experience of the user. Features of RASA empower this  alongwith easy DEV to PROD deployment by use of RASA X.
